# Solid Principles

This repository contains codes for the first deep dive series on Solid Principles.

  - Code related to a principle has its own package under solid. 
  - Principle violated code will be under the violated package, and refactored one will under the refactored package.
  - If you feel we could do better in refactoring, don't forget to create a PR with your changes
  - If you have any feedback, please email us at techtongbd@gmail.com
